I am a graduate student at
[Paris Diderot University (Paris 7)](http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/),
in the second year of the
[Parisian Master of Research in Computer Science (MPRI)](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/)
curriculum. I graduated from the
[ENSEA](http://www.ensea.fr/)
graduate school in electrical engineering and computer science
in 2014.

I am interested in the domains of programming languages, formal
verification, computer architectures, and operating systems, as well
as their applications in the field of computer security.
