I currently work at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/) under the
supervision of
[Cătălin Hriţcu](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/).
I study how micro-policies, a general framework for expressing
hardware-assisted security monitors, could help in designing efficient
secure compilers. A secure (or *fully abstract*) compiler preserves
the abstractions of the source language when translating a program, it
thus allows the programmer to reason about security properties at the
source language level. Please
