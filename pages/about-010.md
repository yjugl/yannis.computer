I currently work as an intern at
[Inria](http://www.inria.fr/)
in
[the Prosecco project](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/)
under the supervision of
[Cătălin Hriţcu](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/)
and
[Bruno Blanchet](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/index-eng.html).

I study how micro-policies, a general framework for expressing
hardware-assisted security monitors, could help in designing efficient
secure compilers. A secure (or *fully abstract*) compiler preserves
the abstractions of the source language when translating a program, it
thus allows the programmer to reason about security properties at the
source language level. Please
[follow this link](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/students/topics/2015/micro-policies-yannis.pdf)
to learn more more about this work.

The next-step will be a PhD on micro-policy composition and secure
compilation, with the same advisors, which I will begin in October
2015 as a
[DGA](http://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga)
and
[Inria](http://www.inria.fr/)
co-funded PhD student.
